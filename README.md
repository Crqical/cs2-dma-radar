# CS2 DMA RADAR

Usage

Run with commands after compilation

java -jar CS2DMA-0.0.1.jar

http://localhost:8080/

For the first time learning to write DMA radar, this is an exercise project, so the code is quite chaotic. Please don't mind.

This code will not be maintained for a long time, so when you try to compile and run it, it may not run. You need to update the CS2 base address in the code.

You can find the latest CS2 game base address and offset here
